        Operators in java 

    2. Arithmatic Operators
        -> +, -, *, /, %.

        -> For All Arithmatic operation the result is MAX(int, type of a, type of b).

        byte b1 = 10;
        byte b2 = 20;
        byte b = b1 + b2; // compile time error.
        byte b = (byte) b1 + b2; // b = 30


        Case 1. 

            System.out.println(10/0);
            -> 10/0 is int/int so the result is int type.
            -> In integer type there is no way to represent Infinity that's why we get RuntimeException. 
            -> for above case the output we get is java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

        Case 2. 

            System.out.println(10.0/0);
            -> 10.0/0 is double/int so the result is double type.
            -> In floting point type there is way to represent Infinity that's why we get Infinity.
            -> for above case the output we get is Infinity.

        Case 3.

            System.out.println(0/0);
            -> 0/0 is int/int so the result is int type.
            -> In integer type there is no way to represent undefined that's why we get RuntimeException.
            -> for above case the output we get is java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
 
        Case 4.

            System.out.println(0/0.0);
            -> 0/0.0 is int/double so the result is double type.
            -> In floting point type there is way to represent undefined that's why we get NaN.
            -> for above case the output we get is NaN.


    ** Regarding Arithmatic Exception**
    -> Arithmetic Exception cause by only / and %.
    ->
